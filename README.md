# Ankayu 😶‍🌫️

Hi, I'm Ankayu, a French Canadian developer.

I have a multitude of passions and I'm always ready to learn new things.

I don't have much else to say about myself; my life isn't very exciting.

- 🔭 Currently, I'm working on a virtual assistant to assist with Discord server management.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning C#.
- 💬 If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
